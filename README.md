# Doors - Level Generation

This project is a remake of the popular game **Doors** on Roblox. I focused on implementing **procedural level generation** to ensure each gameplay experience is unique.

## Features

- **Procedural Level Generation**: Levels are randomly generated each time the game starts, providing a new layout for players to explore.
- **Lua Scripting**: Built with Roblox's Lua programming language for easy integration with the Roblox platform.

## How It Works

The game generates levels by placing rooms and hallways in a random sequence, making sure each one fits within a predefined grid system. This method ensures the layout feels natural while being unpredictable.

### Key Components:

1. **Room Prefabs**: Pre-built room templates that can be combined in different sequences.
2. **Randomization Algorithm**: Ensures that rooms are placed randomly, but logically, so that each level is playable.
3. **Hallways & Doors**: Connect the rooms with hallways and doors to make the level navigable.

## How to Play

1. Clone the project into Roblox Studio.
2. Press Play to see the level generation in action.
3. Navigate through the generated rooms to explore the layout.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Roblox Studio.
3. Customize or expand the level generation logic as needed.
